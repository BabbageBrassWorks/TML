Tartarian Myths and Legends.
By A. S. Ekret

Foreword
 
There are those that say this book is all a fable but not those who have seen him or have been sent to Delphi.
Those that come back are no longer believers in fantasy, they have seen for themselves the alternative futures of humans without the Immortal one. 

In all of human history and the histories before humans, none was found to be so worthy at that time. Some say he was cursed, others say he was blessed.
That he is alive can be testified by those who have seen him, there is no mistaking him for what he is, the Chosen One.

Those who defy him, learned to fear his Black Banner and Golden Horde.
Those conquered by him and his army, prosper and grow mighty.
But there is no forever peace, nor is it forever war.

The Balance is like a three legged stool with legs of three colours Red, Blue and Green.
Only the black banner has more power, but it is restrained power wielded by one who was born mortal 700 hundred years ago and who has been a warrior and military leader unsurpassed in strategy or martial skills and is now immortal.

His death is not allowed by those who watch and guard, they have seen the alternatives.
It is not yet his time and so the game of balance is still being played.

His Kingdom was named Tartar, it no longer exists except in Myths and Legends.
Yet it spans half the globe, but he rules none of it, or all of it depending on your viewpoint or his wishes.

One sage from an alternative timeline has spoken these words, “I reject your reality and substitute  my own”.

Here is the reality we now live in and how it happened.
